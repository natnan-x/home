    `I’ve always been curious about the world and rarely listen to ‘what others say.’ Trial and error is my favorite teacher—though I still take grandma’s advice."`,
    `As I grew up, I met many friends: colleagues, basketball buddies, and cycling companions. Every encounter adds a splash of color to life.`,
    `I have many passions: Higashino Keigo’s novels, exercise, iced Americanos, and cute little animals. Each teaches me something. Higashino once said, 'There are two things you cannot stare at directly: the sun and the human heart.' I choose to keep my heart towards the light. Exercise fuels me like I could go another five hundred years. My three cats and one dog taught me responsibility.`,
    `Now, I’m a front-end developer. Coding feels like solving puzzles and stacking blocks—every line brings a little surprise. New technologies keep coming, whispering: don’t stand still. Embrace change, try boldly—that’s a game for the brave.`,
    `Sincerity, trust, responsibility, positivity, and always facing the sun—these are my labels and my life compass.`,
